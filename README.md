# Distance-Calculator-App
Distance Calculator developed by Objective C and receive data through blocks and delegate objects
In this assignment, you will create an iOS app that calculates the distance from one location to four others. This assignment differs from the previous one because you will be receiving data asynchronously through blocks, not delegate objects, and presenting 4 results simultaneously. 

Your application should include a UITextField for the user to put the initial location into.

Below the field should be a button.

Below this should be a four UITextFields into which users can enter their destination locations. Each UITextField should be paired with a UILabel in which will be displayed the distance from the user-entered location with which it is paired.

When the button is clicked, the interface should calculate the distance from the location the user entered to the four locations chosen by the programmer.
